\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A model results object returned by
\code{\link{extract_DE_results}}.}

\item{annotation}{A dataframe containing annotation data for this analysis.
In our pipeline, usually the "annot" slot from the object returned by
\code{\link{read_DIA_data}}.}

\item{ilab}{The ilab identifier for this project.}

\item{out_dir}{The directory in which to output tables. If not specified,
will construct a directory based on the ilab name and type of analysis.}

\item{norm.method}{The method that was used to normalize the data for the
statistical model being output.}

\item{overwrite}{Should results files be overwritten? Default is F.}

\item{contrasts_subdir}{The subdirectory within out_dir to write the per-contrast
result .csv files. If not specified, will be "per_contrast_results".}

\item{summary_csv}{The filename of the csv file giving a summary of the number
of DE genes per contrast. If not specified, will be "DE_summary.csv".}

\item{combined_file_csv}{The filename of the combined results csv file. If
not specified, will be combined_results.csv.}

\item{spreadsheet_xlsx}{The filename of the Excel spreadsheet containing the
results. If not specified, will construct a name based on the ilab identifier.}

\item{add_filter}{Should per-column filters be added to the spreadsheet?
Default is TRUE. These can sometimes cause unstable spreadsheet files,
try setting to FALSE if you're having issues with the Excel output.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a dataframe with the combined results.

\description{
This wrapper function prepares and then saves a number of tables of results:
\enumerate{
\item A .csv summarizing the number of direction of differentially
expressed genes for each contrast.
\item An Excel spreadsheet of the normalized expression and
statistical results for all contrasts.
\item A results .csv file with the same data as the Excel spreadsheet,
but without all the formatting.
\item A folder of results .csv file which contain the results for each
contrast.
