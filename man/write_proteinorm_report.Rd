}
\arguments{
\item{processed_data}{The output of the  function:
a list object containing processed data and sample information..}

\item{grouping_column}{The name of column within the targets data frame which
gives information on how to group samples for normalization. Must be supplied:
some metrics can't be calculated for only one group.}

\item{out_dir}{The directory in which to save the report. If not provided,
will default to "protein_analysis/01_quality_control".}

\item{file}{The file name of the report to be saved. Must end in .pdf. Will
default to "proteiNorm_Report.pdf" if no filename is provided.}

\item{overwrite}{Should report file be overwritten if it already exists?
Default is FALSE.}

\item{suppress_zoom_legend}{Should the legend be removed from the zoomed
log2ratio plot? Default is FALSE}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Creates and saves as a PDF report a variety of plots which give
information about the performance of different normalization metrics.
