#' Process raw protein data
#'
#' A wrapper function, which calls some subfunctions to filter and normalize
#' raw data. First, calls \code{\link{filter_data}}, which (1) removes samples
#' (columns) that are not present in the targets file, and (2) removes proteins
#' (rows) that do have the minimum number of samples with non-zero intensities
#' in the minumum number of groups. Then, calls \code{\link{normalize_data}}, which
#' runs multiple normalization methods on the the filtered data, so that later
#' you can pick the best normalization method. Also calls \code{\link{make_log}}
#' to make some log files.
#'
#' For filtering, data rows (proteins/peptides) are only retained if they have
#' non-zero intensities in at least min.reps samples and in at least min.grps
#' groups. E.g., with min.reps = 2 and min.groups = 1, a protein must be quantified
#' in two samples within one group to be retained.
#'
#' @param data Raw data to be processed. In the pipeline, this is generally the
#'   "data" slot of the list output by \code{\link{read_DIA_data}}.
#' @param targets An inputs target dataframe. In the pipeline, this is generally
#'   the subsetted targets data frame (that is, with pools or other non-desired
#'   samples removed).
#' @param min.reps For filtering, the minimum number of samples within a group
#'   that need to have non-zero intensity for a given protein/peptide for that
#'   peptide to be considered as quantified within a group.
#' @param min.grps For filtering, the minimum number of groups that must have at
#'   least min.reps non-zero samples for a given protein/peptide to be retained.
#' @param group_col Optional. The name of the column in the targets dataframe which
#'   lists the experimental group names. Default is "group"

#'
#' @return A list with five elements:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item "normList"- a list of length 8, where each item in the list is a
#'       named dataframe. Names give the normalization method, and the dataframe
#'       gives the normalized intensity data
#'     \item "targets" - A dataframe of targets. Should be nearly the same as
#'       the targets dataframe that was input, possibly with new rownames.
#'     \item "filt"- The output of the \code{\link{filter_data}} function: a list
#'       of length 6 containing filtered data and other stats.
#'       See \code{\link{filter_data}}.
#'     \item "param"- A dataframe giving the parameters and arguments used for
#'       data processing
#'     \item "stats"- A dataframe giving statistics on data processing and
#'       filtering.
