abstract = {While mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantification of small molecules has been successfully used for decades, targeted MS has only recently been used by the proteomics community to investigate clinical questions such as biomarker verification and validation. Targeted MS holds the promise of a paradigm shift in the quantitative determination of proteins. Nevertheless, targeted quantitative proteomics requires improvisation in making sample processing, instruments, and data analysis more accessible. In the backdrop of the genomic era reaching its zenith, certain questions arise: is the proteomic era about to come? If we are at the beginning of a new future for protein quantification, are we prepared to incorporate targeted proteomics at the benchside for basic research and at the bedside for the good of patients? Here, an overview of the knowledge required to perform targeted proteomics as well as its applications is provided. A special emphasis is placed on upcoming areas such as peptidomics, proteoform research, and mass spectrometry imaging, where the utilization of targeted proteomics is expected to bring forth new avenues. The limitations associated with the acceptance of this technique for mainstream usage are also highlighted. Also see the video abstract here https://youtu.be/mieB47B8gZw.},

abstract = {Abstract Mass-spectrometry based bottom-up proteomics is the main method to analyze proteomes comprehensively and the rapid evolution of instrumentation and data analysis has made the technology widely available. Data visualization is an integral part of the analysis process and it is crucial for the communication of results. This is a major challenge due to the immense complexity of MS data. In this review, we provide an overview of commonly used visualizations, starting with raw data of traditional and novel MS technologies, then basic peptide and protein level analyses, and finally visualization of highly complex datasets and networks. We specifically provide guidance on how to critically interpret and discuss the multitude of different proteomics data visualizations. Furthermore, we highlight Python-based libraries and other open science tools that can be applied for independent and transparent generation of customized visualizations. To further encourage programmatic data visualization, we provide the Python code used to generate all data figures in this review on GitHub (https://github.com/MannLabs/ProteomicsVisualization).},

The ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium of proteomics resources (http://www.proteomexchange.org) was originally set up to standardize data submission and dissemination of public MS proteomics data. It is now 10 years since the initial data workflow was implemented. In this manuscript, we describe the main developments in PX since the previous update manuscript in Nucleic Acids Research was published in 2020. The six members of the Consortium are PRIDE, PeptideAtlas (including PASSEL), MassIVE, jPOST, iProX and Panorama Public. We report the current data submission statistics, showcasing that the number of datasets submitted to PX resources has continued to increase every year. As of June 2022, more than 34 233 datasets had been submitted to PX resources, and from those, 20 062 (58.6\\%) just in the last three years. We also report the development of the Universal Spectrum Identifiers and the improvements in capturing the experimental metadata annotations. In parallel, we highlight that data re-use activities of public datasets continue to increase, enabling connections between PX resources and other popular bioinformatics resources, novel research and also new data resources. Finally, we summarise the current state-of-the-art in data management practices for sensitive human (clinical) proteomics data.}",

In this manuscript, we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2019. The number of submitted datasets to PRIDE Archive (the archival component of PRIDE) has reached on average around 500 datasets per month during 2021. In addition to continuous improvements in PRIDE Archive data pipelines and infrastructure, the PRIDE Spectra Archive has been developed to provide direct access to the submitted mass spectra using Universal Spectrum Identifiers. As a key point, the file format MAGE-TAB for proteomics has been developed to enable the improvement of sample metadata annotation. Additionally, the resource PRIDE Peptidome provides access to aggregated peptide/protein evidences across PRIDE Archive. Furthermore, we will describe how PRIDE has increased its efforts to reuse and disseminate high-quality proteomics data into other added-value resources such as UniProt, Ensembl and Expression Atlas.}",

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry is widely used for quantitative proteomics studies, relative protein quantification, and differential expression analysis of proteins. Nevertheless, there is a need for a flexible and easy-to-use application programming interface in R that transparently supports a variety of well principled statistical procedures. The prolfqua package can model simple experimental designs with a single explanatory variable and complex experiments with multiple factors and hypothesis testing. It integrates essential steps of the mass spectrometry-based differential expression analysis workflow: quality control, data normalization, protein aggregation, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and sample size estimation. The application programmer interface strives to be clear, predictable, discoverable, and consistent to make proteomics data analysis easy and exciting. Furthermore, the package implements benchmark functionality that can help to compare data acquisition, data preprocessing, or data modeling methods using a gold standard dataset. Finally, we show that the implemented methods allow sensitive and specific differential expression analysis.
